# Infuse.js

Infuse.js provides a uniform API for accessing Javascript-native objects and
arrays, as well as defining futures, signals, inversions, invariants, and other
types of its own. Like jQuery, it maintains a separate prototype for shared
methods and does not monkey-patch any builtin prototypes.

Infuse is quite simply the best Javascript library that could ever possibly
exist, ever. I realize you don't believe me, but that's probably because you
haven't yet checked out the *totally epic* builtin types:

- [arrays](doc/array.md)
- [objects](doc/object.md)
- [multiobjects](doc/multiobject.md)
- [functions](doc/fn.md)
- [futures](doc/future.md)
- [signals](doc/signal.md)
- [edges](doc/edge.md)
- [sorting](doc/sorting.md)
- [awaiting](doc/await.md)

Also useful:

- [methods supported by all types](doc/methods-src.md)
- [global utility functions](doc/util-src.md)

And the low-level stuff:

- [generators](doc/generators.md)
- [versions](doc/versions.md)
- [constructors](doc/constructors.md)
- [heapmap](doc/heapmap.md)

## Building Infuse

You'll need a fairly recent [node.js](http://nodejs.org) build, as well as
UglifyJS to build `infuse.min.js`. If you don't have or want Uglify, you can
`export UGLIFY=no`.

Building is usually as simple as running `make`:

    $ make
    [test output]
    $
