# Infuse signals

See also the [Infuse signal source](signal-src.md).

More encapsulated callbacks! For example:

```js
var f      = infuse.signal();
var called = 0;
var errors = 0;
```

```js
f.size()                        -> 0
f.on('value', function (x) {++called});
f.on('error', function (x) {++errors});
```

```js
called                          -> 0
f.size()                        -> 0
```

```js
var trigger = f.trigger('value');
trigger(5);
called                          -> 1
f.size()                        -> 1
```

If `f` were a future, it would be finalized; but because it's a signal it can
still get new values. For example:

```js
trigger(5);
called                          -> 2
```

If you're using a signal to represent an event, then you'll probably want to
handle error cases somehow. To do that, we just create another trigger:

```js
var ohnoes = f.trigger('error');
errors                          -> 0
ohnoes('something bad happened');
errors                          -> 1
```

One cool thing we can do with signals is reduce them. A future takes on a
series of values over time, so we can build a new signal whose values represent
an accumulation. For example:

```js
var g = f.reductions(0, '_1 + _2');
var g_called = 0;
```

```js
g.on('value', function (x) {++g_called});
```

```js
g_called                        -> 0
g.size()                        -> 0
```

```js
trigger(1);
g.size()                        -> 1
g.value()                       -> 1
g_called                        -> 1
```

```js
trigger(2);
g.value()                       -> 3
trigger(3);
g.value()                       -> 6
```

When you want to free memory, you can detach a derivative signal from its base.
This prevents it from receiving future events from that base.

```js
g.detach();
trigger(4);
g.value()                       -> 6
```

You can't detach callbacks because they aren't Infuse objects (internally, the
problem is that they have no string identifier). However, you have two options
for working around this. One is to use `once` instead of `on`, which works if
you just need the first event. The other is to create a derivative signal that
triggers the anonymous callbacks.

```js
var once_called = 0;
g.once('value', function (x) {
  ++once_called                 -> 1
  x                             -> 10
});
```

```js
g.push(10, 'value');
once_called                     -> 1
g.value()                       -> 10
```

```js
g.push(15, 'value');
once_called                     -> 1
g.value()                       -> 15

```
