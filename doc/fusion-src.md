Infuse stream fusion | Spencer Tipping

# Introduction

Stream fusion allows Infuse to bypass intermediate array/object/etc allocation,
inlining the logic into JIT-compiled functions. This logic also supports things
like inner loop unrolling.

```js
infuse.extend(function (infuse) {
```

```js
// TODO
```

```js
});

```
