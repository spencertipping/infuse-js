Infuse objects.
Like Infuse arrays, objects can be constructed either by wrapping an existing
object or by specifying a generator function. If you specify a generator, the
object's value (as returned by `get`, etc) will be updated as new elements
become available.

Infuse objects are not considered to be ordered unless you call `keys` or
`values`. Each of these methods takes a sorted snapshot of the key list to
guarantee traversal order; so you could request `keys` and `values` and know
that `k[0]` corresponded to `v[0]`, for instance.

infuse.extend(function (infuse) {
infuse.type('object', function (object, methods) {

// Use pull-propagation updating
infuse.mixins.pull(methods);

Object state.
Like an Infuse array, an object has a backing which may be externally
allocated, and for internally-allocated backings it also has a generator and a
base.

methods.initialize = function (o_or_f, base) {
  if (o_or_f instanceof Function)
    this.o_         = {},
    this.base_      = infuse.assert(base,
                        'infuse: attempted to construct a derivative '
                      + 'object without specifying a base'),
    this.generator_ = o_or_f,
    this.version_   = -1,
    this.journal_   = infuse.aatree(),
    this.pull();
  else
    this.o_         = o_or_f,
    this.base_      = null,
    this.generator_ = null,
    this.version_   = 1,
    this.journal_   = null;
};

methods.tos = function () {
  return (this.base_ ? '#{' : 'I{')
       + this.keys().sort().map('_ + ": " + o[_]', {o: this.o_}).join(', ')
       + '}';
};

Size is the number of distinct key/value pairs stored in the object. This
function needs to be amortized O(1), so we use the journal to tell us how many
items we have.

methods.size = function () {return this.pull().journal().size()};

methods.push_ = function (v, k) {
  var o = this.o_;
  o[k] = v;
  this.journal().push(this.version_, k);
  return this;
};

Derivatives.
Objects can have derivatives just like arrays can, but the behavior is
different. An object derivative means "the object will gain new key/value
mappings in the future", much as an array derivative means "the array will grow
in the future". So it's a partial journal of changes that will be made to the
object.

The main difference between the two is the degree of assumption about
immutability. Arrays are only allowed to grow; we assume that elements already
in the array won't change. Objects, on the other hand, might receive value
updates for existing keys; a common case of this is when you're indexing
something. This means that a simple array journal has the potential to be
arbitrarily larger than the object it represents (since it's storing each
intermediate change).

As a result, we don't keep the journal this way. Instead, we just use an object
that maps each key to the last version at which it was modified. Each generator
can then search this object and apply updates. This makes searching O(n) when
the object has been updated, O(1) otherwise.

methods.derivative = function (generator, version_base) {
  var f = infuse.fn(generator);
  return infuse.object(f, version_base || this);
};

methods.journal = function () {
  var j = this.journal_;
  if (!j) {
    var o = this.o_,
        v = this.version_;

    // Update all keys to the current version.
    j = this.journal_ = infuse.aatree();
    for (var k in o)
      if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o, k))
        j.push(v, k);
  }
  return j;
};

Traversal.
This is tricky. We need to go through the object's keys in the right order, but
we can't use the `keys` function to do it because `keys` is defined in terms of
`generator`. Instead, we maintain a maxheap of key -> version and use that to
pull changes.

methods.generator = function () {
  var journal_generator = this.journal().generator(),
      o                 = this.o_;
  return function (emit) {
    // The version generator passes the version as 'v' and the key as 'k'; we
    // just need to translate that into our value for the key.
    return journal_generator(function (v, k) {return emit(o[k], k)});
  };
};

Retrieval.
Objects don't support `first` or `last`, but they do support `get`, which takes
a string or array of strings.

methods.get = function (k) {
  var o = this.pull().o_;

  // get() -> the current backing object (don't modify this!)
  if (k === void 0) return o;

  // get(k) -> o[k]
  if (typeof k === typeof '' || k instanceof String) return o[k];

  return this.get_default.apply(this, arguments);
};

});

Object promotion.
Detecting a vanilla object turns out to be tricky. We can't do the obvious `x
instanceof Object` because everything is an instance of `Object`. Long story
short, we have to rely on `Object.prototype.toString` to tell us.

var obj_tos = Object.prototype.toString.call({});
infuse.alternatives.push(
  {accepts:   function (x) {return Object.prototype.toString.call(x) === obj_tos
                                && !(x instanceof infuse)},
   construct: function (x) {return infuse.object(x)}});

});
