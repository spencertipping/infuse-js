Introduction.
A future is a container for a value that will become available later on,
generally by an asynchronous callback. Futures represent callbacks that have
not yet been invoked, allowing you to transform the values they will receive or
otherwise manipulate them as objects.

Things you can do trivially with futures that are more difficult with just
callbacks include having an indefinite number of listeners for the result and
combining N pending results into a single object. Futures are also useful for
chaining asynchronous computations, but callbacks don't make this particularly
difficult to begin with.

infuse.extend(function (infuse) {
infuse.type('future', function (future, methods) {

infuse.mixins.push(methods);

Future state.
Each future contains a key and a result; the key contextualizes the value and
is emitted from generators when the value is delivered. Futures have two
states, undelivered and delivered, and the only transition that happens is from
undelivered to delivered. So for most purposes they are immutable, and they
converge to immutable objects. (If you don't want this convergence, you should
use a signal instead.)

Because we have this immutability, we can unlink all derivatives once the state
is finalized.

methods.initialize = function (generator, base) {
  this.listeners_ = {};         // null once the future is decided
  this.bases_     = {};         // null once the future is decided
  this.value_     = null;
  this.key_       = null;
  this.generator_ = null;       // generated on demand

  if (generator) {
    infuse.assert(base,
      'infuse: attempted to construct a derivative future without specifying '
    + 'a base');

    var self = this;
    generator(function (v, k) {return self.push(v, k)}, this.id());
    this.bases_[base.id()] = base;
  }
};

methods.tos = function () {
  return (this.is_derivative() ? '#future(' : 'future(')
    + (this.size() ? this.value_ + (this.key_ == null ? '' : ', ' + this.key_)
                   : '')
    + ')';
};

methods.size = function () {return +!this.listeners_};
methods.key  = function () {return this.key_};

Derivatives.
Future derivatives are push-notified, not pull-notified, so they work
differently. We create the derivative and doubly-link it to the base for
reasons I'll explain in more detail later. At that point we don't need to do
anything else until we get a value through `push`.

methods.derivative = function (generator, version_base) {
  var f = infuse.fn.apply(this, arguments);
  return infuse.future(f, version_base || this);
};

Future generators support ID-less emit function registrations. Signals don't
because a signal will hold onto such a function indefinitely, but futures let
go of the functions once they are decided, so the scope of the space leak is
less egregious. It's still a better idea to use `on` or `once` to get a
singleton future that you use for the callback; that way you can free both by
calling `detach`.

methods.generator = function () {
  var g = this.generator_;
  if (!g) {
    var self = this;
    g = this.generator_ = function (emit, id) {
      var ls = self.listeners_;
      if (ls) ls[id || infuse.gen_id()] = emit;
      else    return emit(self.value_, self.key_);
    };
  }
  return g;
};

methods.push = function (v, k) {
  infuse.assert(this.listeners_,
    'infuse: attempted to push to an already-decided future');

  // Alert listeners...
  var ls = this.listeners_;
  for (var id in ls)
    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(ls, id))
      ls[id](v, k);

  this.detach();
  this.listeners_ = null;       // ... and then free them; we are now immutable
  this.value_     = v;
  this.key_       = k;
  return this;
};

Retrieval.
Futures are modeled sort of like objects with a single key/value after they're
decided, and no existence at all before they're decided.

methods.get = function (k) {
  // get() -> v if decided, null if undecided
  if (k === void 0) return this.value_;

  // get(k) -> v if decided and k === key, otherwise null
  if (typeof k === typeof '' || k instanceof String)
    if (k === this.key_) return this.value_;
    else                 return null;

  return this.get_default.apply(this, arguments);
};

Callback interface.
You can use a future to invoke a callback, and you can also create a callback
that will trigger the future when you invoke it. Each of these use cases ties a
key to the callback, which is useful for things like error processing. See the
future tests for examples.

methods.on = function (keygate, callback, id) {
  keygate = infuse.keygate(keygate);

  // on(keygate) -> signal
  if (!callback) {
    var g = this.generator();
    return infuse.signal(function (emit, id) {
      g(function (v, k) {if (keygate(k)) return emit(v, k)}, id);
    }, this);
  }

  // on(keygate, callback) -> this
  callback = infuse.fn(callback);
  this.generator()(function (v, k) {if (keygate(k)) callback(v, k)},
                   id || infuse.gen_id());
  return this;
};

Futures can be resolved at most once, so these methods do the same thing. (But
this is not the case for signals.) Note that it is not a good idea for `once()`
to optimize the no-keygate case, for two reasons. First, the user can change
the behavior of an unspecified (undefined) keygate; and second, the result
should always be different from the receiver so that calling `detach` on it
won't disrupt the receiver's derivative status.

methods.once = function (keygate, callback, id) {
  keygate = infuse.keygate(keygate);

  // once(keygate) -> future
  if (!callback) {
    var g = this.generator();
    return this.derivative(function (emit, id) {
      g(function (v, k) {if (keygate(k)) return emit(v, k)}, id);
    });
  }

  // once(keygate, callback) -> this
  return this.on(keygate, callback, id);
};

methods.trigger = function (k) {
  var self = this;
  return function (v) {self.push(v, k)};
};

});
});
