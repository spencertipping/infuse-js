Infuse arrays.
Infuse gives you two options for working with arrays. You can promote an
existing array, in which case the `force()` method will provide no new data and
will throw an error. Alternatively, you can invoke `infuse.array()` on a
generator function to create an array-backed lazy sequence. If you do this,
`force()` will add elements to the end of the array if any are available.

A secondary consequence of using a generator function is that derivative
arrays, objects, etc, are themselves lazy. In these cases, forcing derivative
`map`, `filter`, etc results will cause more elements to be dynamically
generated and transformed accordingly. (Internally this happens when the `pull`
method is called.)

infuse.extend(function (infuse) {
infuse.type('array', function (array, methods) {

Mixins.
Arrays are "pulling" collections: derivatives are linked to their sources, not
the other way around.

infuse.mixins.pull(methods);

Array state.
Every Infuse array is backed by a Javascript array. If the backing was provided
as a constructor argument, then we aren't allowed to modify it; so the sequence
is considered to be definite and can't have a generator.

Otherwise the sequence is a generated array, in which case we allocate a
private backing and fill it as the user forces things.

methods.initialize = function (xs_or_f, base) {
  if (xs_or_f instanceof Function)
    this.xs_        = [],
    this.base_      = base,
    this.generator_ = xs_or_f,
    this.version_   = -1,
    this.pull();
  else
    this.xs_        = xs_or_f instanceof Array
                      ? xs_or_f
                      : infuse.toa(xs_or_f),
    this.base_      = null,
    this.generator_ = null,
    this.version_   = 1;
};

Size is always expressed as the number of items currently realized, not the
eventual size of a lazy sequence. Any given lazy sequence will be both finite
(as its size is finite) and indefinite at the same time, and operations such as
`map` and `flatmap` will apply eagerly to the currently-realized part.

methods.size = function () {return this.pull().xs_.length};

We mixin the `pull` behavior, which relies on this `push_` method to actually
add things to the array. We don't need to worry about versioning.

methods.push_ = function (v, k) {
  this.xs_.push(v);
  return this;
};

Derivatives.
Laziness requires that we pass on certain metadata about the base whenever we
construct any derivative. To do this, we have the derivative link to its base
so that any new elements on the base can be transformed accordingly.

methods.derivative = function (generator, version_base) {
  var f = infuse.fn(generator);
  return infuse.array(f, version_base || this);
};

Traversal.
A generator is a stateful iterator that takes an emitter function and invokes
it once for each item in the array. It re-checks the array's size each time it
is called, so a generator can represent a collection whose size changes over
time.

methods.generator = function () {
  var i = 0, self = this;
  return function (emit) {
    for (var xs = self.pull().xs_, l = xs.length; i < l;)
      // It's important to do the increment here so that it happens even if we
      // break out of the loop.
      if (emit(xs[i], i++) === false) return false;
  };
};

Retrieval.
Technically we just need to implement `get` here. `first` and `last` can, in
theory, be derived from `each`, `size`, and `get`. However, doing things that
way is inefficient for arrays because we have direct access to the elements.

methods.get = function (n, fn) {
  var xs = this.pull().xs_;

  // get() -> the current backing array (don't modify this!)
  if (n === void 0) return xs;

  // get(n) -> xs[n] or xs[n + length] if n is negative
  if (typeof n === typeof 0 || n instanceof Number)
    if (n === n >> 0)
      // n is an integer; use direct indexing (but wrap if negative)
      return xs[n < 0 ? xs.length + n : n];
    else {
      // n is a float; use interpolation.
      var f  = arguments.length > 1
               ? infuse.fnarg(arguments, 1)
               : function (a, b, x) {return a + (b-a)*x},
          i1 = (n < 0 ? xs.length : 0) + Math.floor(n),
          i2 = i1 + 1,
          x  = n - i1;
      return f(xs[i1], xs[i2], x);
    }

  // get(...) = fn(...)(this, this.id())
  return infuse.fn.apply(this, arguments)(this, this.id());
};

methods.first = function (n) {
  var xs = this.get();

  // first() -> the single first element
  if (n === void 0) return xs[0];

  // first(n) -> infuse([x0, x1, ..., xn-1])
  if (typeof n === typeof 0 || n instanceof Number)
    return infuse.array(xs.slice(0, n < 0 ? xs.length + n : n));

  // first(f) -> the first element that satisfies f, or null
  var f = infuse.fn.apply(this, arguments);
  for (var i = 0, l = xs.length; i < l; ++i)
    if (f(xs[i], i)) return xs[i];
  return null;
};

methods.last = function (n) {
  var xs = this.get(),
      xl = xs.length;

  // last() -> the single last element
  if (n === void 0) return xs[xl - 1];

  // last(n) -> infuse([xn, xn+1, ..., xl-1])
  if (typeof n === typeof 0 || n instanceof Number)
    // Check for n == 0 to save an array copy if at all possible
    return infuse.array(n === 0 ? xs : xs.slice(n < 0 ? xl + n : n));

  // last(f) -> the last element that satisfies f, or null
  var f = infuse.fn.apply(this, arguments);
  for (var i = xl - 1; i >= 0; ++i)
    if (f(xs[i], i)) return xs[i];
  return null;
};

});     // end infuse.type('array')

Array promotion.
This hook allows you to say `infuse([1, 2, 3])` and get back an `infuse.array`
object.

infuse.alternatives.push(
  {accepts:   function (x) {return x instanceof Array},
   construct: function (x) {return infuse.array(x)}});

});
