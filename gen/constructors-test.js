// Infuse types and constructors.
// Every Infuse object is an instance of the global `infuse`, as well as being an
// instance of its constructor. For example:

infuse.assert_equal((infuse([]) instanceof infuse                    ), (true));
infuse.assert_equal((infuse([]) instanceof infuse.array              ), (true));

infuse.assert_equal((infuse({}) instanceof infuse                    ), (true));
infuse.assert_equal((infuse({}) instanceof infuse.object             ), (true));

// Infuse objects never inherit from each other, however. The only inheritance is
// from `infuse`.

infuse.assert_equal((infuse([]) instanceof infuse.object             ), (false));

// These inheritance properties also apply to asynchronous objects:

infuse.assert_equal((infuse.future() instanceof infuse               ), (true));
infuse.assert_equal((infuse.future() instanceof infuse.future        ), (true));
infuse.assert_equal((infuse.signal() instanceof infuse               ), (true));
infuse.assert_equal((infuse.signal() instanceof infuse.signal        ), (true));
