// Infuse object versioning.
// There are some rules governing the way updates are propagated between objects.
// First, some background. Each object is append-only, so in some sense it gains
// information over time. This monotonic information gain is represented by the
// object's version, which is a number that increases each time the object
// changes:

var xs = $i([]);

infuse.assert_equal((xs.version()                           ), (1));
infuse.assert_equal((xs.push(1)                             ), (xs));
infuse.assert_equal((xs.version()                           ), (2));
infuse.assert_equal((xs.push(2).push(3)                     ), (xs));
infuse.assert_equal((xs.version()                           ), (4));
infuse.assert_equal((xs.size()                              ), (3));

// Infuse makes no guarantees about the absolute values of the version, just that
// it increases each time an object is changed. (A "change" here can mean that an
// array gets five new elements, for instance; there is no 1:1 relationship, just
// the requirement that each change be atomic.)

// Derivatives are generally updated using generators. A generator is a one-pass
// iterator over an object that invokes an emitter function. Emitters usually wrap
// the `push` method in some fairly trivial way. For example:

var g  = xs.generator();
var ys = xs.derivative(function (emit) {
  g(function (v, k) {
    emit(v, k);
  });
});

infuse.assert_equal((ys.size()                              ), (3));
infuse.assert_equal((ys.version()                           ), (4));
infuse.assert_equal((ys.join(',')                           ), ('1,2,3'));

// This is how almost all of the transformation methods work. For example, here's
// how `map` is implemented:

var f      = $i.fn('_ * 3');
var g2     = xs.generator();
var mapped = xs.derivative(function (emit) {
  g2(function (v, k) {
    emit(f(v, k), k);
  });
});

infuse.assert_equal((mapped.size()                          ), (3));
infuse.assert_equal((mapped.version()                       ), (4));
infuse.assert_equal((mapped.join(',')                       ), ('3,6,9'));
