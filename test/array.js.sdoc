Infuse arrays.
When you say `infuse([1, 2, 3])`, Infuse selects the `infuse.array` alternative
and invokes that instead, as if you had written `infuse.array([1, 2, 3])`:

infuse([1, 2, 3]).size()        -> 3
infuse.array([1, 2, 3]).size()  -> 3

Like all Infuse objects, arrays support `size`, `get`, and a number of other
accessor methods:

var xs = infuse([1, 2, 3]);
xs.get(0)                       -> 1
xs.get(-1)                      -> 3

For arrays specifically, Infuse gives you generic linear interpolation between
elements:

xs.get(0.5)                     -> 1.5

var quadratic = function (a, b, x) {return a + (b - a) * x*x};
xs.get(0.5, quadratic)          -> 1.25
xs.get(0, quadratic)            -> 1

And without arguments, `get` returns a regular Javascript array:

xs.get()[0]                     -> 1
xs.get().length                 -> 3

Transformations.
Arrays can be transformed eagerly and lazily. For example:

var ys = xs.map('_ + 1');
ys.version()                    -> 0
ys.size()                       -> 3
ys.get().join(',')              -> '2,3,4'
