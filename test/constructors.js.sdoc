Infuse types and constructors.
Every Infuse object is an instance of the global `infuse`, as well as being an
instance of its constructor. For example:

infuse([]) instanceof infuse                    -> true
infuse([]) instanceof infuse.array              -> true

infuse({}) instanceof infuse                    -> true
infuse({}) instanceof infuse.object             -> true

Infuse objects never inherit from each other, however. The only inheritance is
from `infuse`.

infuse([]) instanceof infuse.object             -> false

These inheritance properties also apply to asynchronous objects:

infuse.future() instanceof infuse               -> true
infuse.future() instanceof infuse.future        -> true
infuse.signal() instanceof infuse               -> true
infuse.signal() instanceof infuse.signal        -> true

You can convert between Infuse collection types using `into`. For example:

var o = infuse(['foo', 'bar', 'bif']).into(infuse.object);
o.keys().sort().join(',')                       -> '0,1,2'
o.get(['0', '1', '2']).join(',')                -> 'foo,bar,bif'

var o = {};
infuse(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']).into(o);
o['0']                                          -> 'a'
o['3']                                          -> 'd'

var o  = infuse({foo: 'bar', bif: 'baz'});
var xs = [];
o.into(xs)                                      -> xs
xs.sort().join(',')                             -> 'bar,baz'

The same mechanism works between synchronous and asynchronous objects.

var sig = infuse.signal();
var o   = infuse({});
sig.into(o)                                     -> o
sig.push(4, 'foo').push(5, 'bar')               -> sig
o.size()                                        -> 2
o.keys().sort().join(',')                       -> 'bar,foo'
o.get(['foo', 'bar']).join(',')                 -> '4,5'

At this point `o` is not a proper derivative of `sig`, nor can it be since
Infuse objects can never transition into being derivatives. However, signals
can forward events to things that are not technically derivatives of
themselves, and you can remove any such quasiderivative by using the
`detach_derivative` method:

sig.detach_derivative(o)                        -> sig
sig.push(6, 'bif')                              -> sig
o.size()                                        -> 2

The `from` method works just like `into` but
