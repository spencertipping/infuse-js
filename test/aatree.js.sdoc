AA trees.
AA trees are used by Infuse as a journaling structure for mutable-object
updates.

var t = $i.aatree();
t.push(1, 4);

var called = 0;
t.generator()(function (v, k) {
  v                                     -> 1
  k                                     -> 4
  ++called;
});
called                                  -> 1

var called = 0;
t.push(2, 5);
t.generator()(function (v, k) {
  if (called === 0) {
    v                                   -> 1
    k                                   -> 4
  } else {
    v                                   -> 2
